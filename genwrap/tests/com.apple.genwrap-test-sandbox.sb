;; We specifically want to keep file-read-metadata denied by default, along with
;; process-exec.  The former will be used to confirm that being denied the
;; ability to readlink(2) in /var/select won't stop us from executing the
;; default application, and the latter will be used to confirm that we can
;; fallback to another choice if we were denied the application we wanted to
;; execute.

;; Odds and ends required for basic functionality that doesn't open us up to
;; accidentally being able to exec $ALLOWED_BINARY_PATH

;; The binaries we want to restrict will never be in our test install directory,
;; so we'll at least allow that to avoid having to mess with this profile any
;; further if we want to expand the test somehow.
